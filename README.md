## About
In this assignment, the UK Food Standards Agency evaluates various establishments across the United Kingdom, and gives them a food hygiene rating. I've been contracted by the editors of a food magazine, Eat Safe, Love, to evaluate some of the ratings data in order to help their journalists and food critics decide where to focus future articles.

## Getting Started
Jupyter Notebook is required to run this project.
